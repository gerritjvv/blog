# Overview

The idea behind this is to write down what is required to win, or solve the problem.
Rather than focusing on how you start, you work on the last few steps of the solution itself.


## Solving a simple game

There are two players, and at each turn a player can select a number of 1 to 7 inclusively.
The number is added to the number selected in the previous round. 
The player that selects a number that adds up to 100 or bigger looses.
